# Building

## Master Builder

building happens inside a city
select a building type from the list
pay the price - money - (time) - resources - wood

Money gets taken from global player treasury.
Resources get taken from - all the convoys of the player inside the city and/or from counting house inside city (if built) -> Pat2/3 - you need to gather ALL resources up front which is annoying (and frustrating when you're missing 1 wood out of 50) - they get bought from market as available -> PR4, Pat4 - when does this happen? - on build - on schedule (e.g. once per day) - before or after production/consumption? - how is pricing calculated then? - baseprice + buy as much as possible from market - what if there are not enough resources on the market at build time? - very user friendly as there is really just one button to press and one price to pay

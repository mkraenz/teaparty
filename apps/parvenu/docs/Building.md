# Building

building happens inside a city
select a building type from the list
pay the price
    - money
    - (time)
    - resources
      - wood

Money gets taken from global player treasury.
Resources get taken from
    - all the convoys of the player inside the city and/or from counting house inside city (if built) -> Pat2/3
        - you need to gather ALL resources up front which is annoying (and frustrating when you're missing 1 wood out of 50)
    - they get bought from market as available -> PR4, Pat4
      - when does this happen?
        - on build
        - on schedule (e.g. once per day)
            - before or after production/consumption?
      - how is pricing calculated then?
        - baseprice + buy as much as possible from market
        - what if there are not enough resources on the market at build time?
      - very user friendly as there is really just one button to press and one price to pay
